✅ Level-2 C Programming – For & While Loops

In Level-2 C programming, I learned how to use loops to repeat tasks efficiently. Using for loops and while loops, I solved multiple problems that involved repetition, counting, and pattern generation.

✅ Skills Covered

Writing and controlling for loops

Using while and do-while loops

Incrementing, decrementing, and loop conditions

Nested loops for advanced output patterns

Breaking and continuing loop execution

✅ Example Problem Types

Printing number sequences (1 to N, even/odd numbers, multiplication tables)

Sum of digits and factorial of a number

Finding minimum/maximum values in range

Reversing numbers using loops

Generating star patterns / triangle patterns

Searching through digits or lists using loops

✅ Learning Outcome

By completing these problems, I learned:

How repetitive tasks can be automated using loops

How loop logic is used in real programs

Strong problem-solving and logical thinking skills
