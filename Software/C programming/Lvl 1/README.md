✅ Level-1 C Programming – If-Else Problem Set

In Level-1 C programming, I learned and practiced conditional statements using the if, else if, and else structures. To apply the concept, I solved 30+ problems that involved decision-making based on different input conditions.

✅ Skills Covered

Writing conditional logic using if, else if, and else

Comparing values using relational and logical operators

Handling simple decision-based programs

Taking user input and producing interactive output

Testing edge cases and multiple conditions

✅ Example Problem Types

Checking positive/negative/zero

Finding largest number among three values

Grading system using conditions

Even/odd number identification

Simple calculators using conditional logic

Character classification (vowel/consonant, uppercase/lowercase)

Temperature or age-based decisions

✅ Learning Outcome

By solving more than 30 problems, I gained confidence in:

Understanding program flow

Structuring logic for real-world cases

Debugging and improving problem-solving skills
