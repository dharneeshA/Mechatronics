Pneumatic Cylinder Holder – SolidWorks CAD Model

This project is a 3D CAD model of a pneumatic cylinder holder designed in SolidWorks.
The component is used to securely fix a pneumatic cylinder in place during mechanical or automation operations.

✅ Purpose of the Design

To create a stable mounting base for a pneumatic cylinder

To prevent vibration or movement during operation

To ensure accurate alignment of the cylinder with other mechanical parts

🔧 Features of the Model

Mounting slots/holes for bolts or screws

Support surface for the cylinder body

Curved or V-shaped profile for proper cylinder seating

Designed with appropriate dimensions for stability and strength

🧠 Skills Applied

2D sketching and geometric constraints

Extrude, cut, fillet, and chamfer operations

Dimensioning and tolerance consideration

Understanding real-world manufacturability

📌 What this project demonstrates

This was my first SolidWorks CAD model, created to learn:

How mechanical components are designed digitally

Basics of part modeling and feature creation

How CAD helps in real engineering solutions
