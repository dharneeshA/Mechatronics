My First CAD Model – Fusion 360 (Beginner Project)

This is the first 3D CAD model I created using Autodesk Fusion 360.
The purpose of this project was to learn the basics of computer-aided design, including sketching, dimensioning, constraints, and 3D features like extrude, fillet, and cut.

✅ What this model demonstrates

Creating a 2D sketch and applying accurate dimensions

Converting sketches into a 3D solid

Editing geometry using tools such as extrude, fillet, and chamfer

Understanding the design history and parametric workflow in Fusion 360

🔧 Skills learned

Using reference planes and constraints

Precise measurement and parametric control

Basic surface modeling and solid modeling

Exporting and displaying the final 3D model

📌 Why this model is important

This project represents the beginning of my CAD journey — from basic shapes to designing real mechanical parts. Everything I create after this builds on the skills learned here.
