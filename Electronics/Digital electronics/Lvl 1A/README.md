Digital Electronics – Basic LED Control using Push Buttons & Resistors

This project demonstrates a fundamental Digital 1A level electronics concept: controlling an LED using push buttons and resistors.
The experiment shows how digital signals (HIGH/LOW) can be created manually using switches, and how current-limiting resistors protect the LED.

✅ What this circuit does

When the push button is pressed, the LED turns ON

When the button is released, the LED turns OFF

The resistor limits the current to prevent LED damage

🔧 Components Used

1 × LED

1 × Push Button

1 × Resistor (220Ω–1kΩ recommended)

Breadboard & connecting wires

5V DC supply or Arduino 5V pin

🧠 Concept

The push button completes the circuit, sending a HIGH signal to the LED.
The resistor ensures safe current flow.
This introduces beginner digital logic and switch-based control.

📌 Learning Outcome

Understanding how digital input can control output

Getting familiar with pull-up / pull-down connections

Basic current limiting and LED protection
