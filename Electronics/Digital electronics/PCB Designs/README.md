This section contains PCB layouts for basic logic circuits designed using standard digital logic gates. Instead of using breadboards or loose components, these circuits are implemented on custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) to create a clean, permanent, and professional design.

✅ What these PCBs demonstrate

Each PCB represents a specific logic gate circuit, such as:

NOT Gate

AND Gate

OR Gate

NAND Gate

NOR Gate

XOR / XNOR Gate

The PCBs use IC chips, resistors, and LED indicators to show logic output:

LED ON = Logic HIGH (1)

LED OFF = Logic LOW (0)

🔧 Features of the PCBs

Designed using standard logic ICs from the 74xx or 40xx digital families

Input switches or push buttons for providing digital logic levels

Current-limiting resistors to protect LEDs

Clearly labeled power pins, inputs, and outputs

Neat and permanent PCB layout instead of temporary breadboard wiring

🧠 Purpose of the project

To show how real logic circuits are fabricated into PCB form

To convert theoretical logic gates into a professional electronic product

To understand PCB design basics: routing, footprints, pad connections, and power rails

📌 Learning Outcomes

Understanding practical circuit layout

Experience in converting schematic → PCB

Proper use of ICs, power supply, and LED logic indication

Foundation for advanced digital electronics and larger PCB projects

If you want individual descriptions

I can also write separate descriptions for:
✅ AND gate PCB
✅ NOR gate PCB
✅ NOT gate PCB
✅ NAND gate PCB, etc.
