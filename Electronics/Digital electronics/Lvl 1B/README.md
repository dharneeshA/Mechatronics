This project demonstrates how basic digital logic can be built using discrete components instead of integrated IC chips. By using transistors, push buttons, and resistors, logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR can be formed manually.

✅ Concept

Push buttons act as manual digital inputs

Pressed → HIGH (1)

Released → LOW (0)

Transistors function as electronic switches

They turn ON/OFF depending on base input voltage

LEDs are used as logic outputs to show HIGH (glow) or LOW (off)

🔧 Components Used

NPN Transistors (e.g., BC547 / 2N2222)

Push Buttons

Resistors (for base current limiting and pull-up/pull-down)

LED and power supply

Breadboard and wiring

🧠 What this teaches

How logic gates work at the transistor level

How digital HIGH/LOW is generated with switches

How combining multiple transistors forms real logic operations

Intro to fundamental digital electronics without ICs

📌 Learning Outcome

You learn the foundation of digital circuits — how a simple transistor switch becomes the building block of all logic gates and processors.
