Logic Gates Using Integrated Circuits (ICs)

This project demonstrates how basic logic gates can be implemented using standard digital ICs instead of transistors or switches. Each IC contains internal transistor networks that perform fixed logic operations.

✅ What this shows

Using ICs, we can build:

NOT Gate – Inverts the input

AND Gate – Output is HIGH only when all inputs are HIGH

OR Gate – Output is HIGH when any input is HIGH

NAND Gate – Opposite of AND

NOR Gate – Opposite of OR

XOR / XNOR – Exclusive logic operations

LEDs are used as the output indicator:

LED ON → Logic HIGH (1)

LED OFF → Logic LOW (0)

🔧 Common ICs Used
Gate	IC Number
NOT	7404 / 74HC04
AND	7408
OR	7432
NAND	7400
NOR	7402
XOR	7486
XNOR	74HC266
✅ How the circuit works

Push buttons or switches provide digital inputs

The IC processes the logic

The LED displays the resulting output

🧠 What this teaches

How logic gates work at the chip level

Understanding Vcc, Ground, input pins, and output pins

How ICs simplify digital design compared to discrete transistors

Foundation for building large digital systems like adders, counters, and microprocessors

📌 Learning Outcome

You learn how to implement logic operations using real IC chips, making this the first step toward practical digital circuit design.
